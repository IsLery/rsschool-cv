#### Summary
No different from other Belarusians with a golden dream of “getting into IT” I am 25 years old, with 2-year working experience as an economist in the e-commerce field and in desperate need to change my career path. As I have always regretted choosing English over Physics in the Centralized Testing (that was a dark time when you could take only 3 tests), now I would like to get over with it and finally become a programmer. Last year I won a grant for education in Israel: 8-month course of Web and Android development, which I will have finish at the beginning of May. By now I realized, that I really enjoy android development, where logic and algorithms are combined with various cool buttons and other widgets and you can almost immediately see the changes you have applied.
For now I have some basic knowledge of Java and Java on Android, tiny idea of Javascript (though it is no use here) and would like to learn at least a bit of Kotlin. My current priority is to gain enough knowledge and experience to acquire a job as junior android developer and I intend to make maximum effort to reach this goal.
