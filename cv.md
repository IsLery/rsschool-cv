#### Summary
Two tolerable years of my working experience (bless our "free" education) as an economist after not-so-great-as-it-seemed education in the faculty of international relations made me realize, that not only I still have no idea wtf economists do, but also that I really don't want to know. Still all that time I wondered, who and where would I be, if I had chosen different path. So, when my graduate placemant was finally over, I decided to kill two birds in one shot and enrolled to programming courses. There I have found myself really enjoying android development even despite the lack of experience.
